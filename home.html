                    Scheduled to take place on October 20, 2023, at the Main Campus in Candon City, Ilocos Sur,
                     the Kapuso Master Class Icon Series is made possible through the generous support of the Federated Supreme Student Council.

                      unparalleled opportunities for growth and learning to the nation's youth.
                    During the event, students will have the unique privilege of learning directly from leaders spanning various fields.
                     These accomplished individuals will share their expertise and experiences, providing invaluable lessons and guidance,
                      thereby igniting the spark of inspiration within the attendees.
                    As the GMA Network takes another significant step towards educational development, students across 
                    Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao can look forward to enriching their minds and embarking on a journey of personal and professional growth.
